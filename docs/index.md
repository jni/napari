  metaDescription: napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

# napari

Napari is a fast, multi-dimensional image viewer for the Python programming
language. It also aims to provide GUI-based access to the scientific Python
image analysis ecosystem.

```python
import napari
viewer = napari.view_image(my_array)
```

      title="Your browser does not support the video tag." />
</video>

Napari can help you:

- quickly *view* 2D, 3D, and higher-dimensional image data
- *overlay* segmentations (labels), points, vectors, polygons, surface meshes,
  vectors, and tracking data
- *annotate* data, seamlessly weaving human curation with scripts and
  interactive sessions using Python
- *analyze* data with a [rich ecosystem of plugins](https://napari-hub.org)
- and [more!](https://napari.org/community)
